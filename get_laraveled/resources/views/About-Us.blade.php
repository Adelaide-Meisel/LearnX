                <p>My name is Brodie Kirby, I am one of the co-founders of LearnX. I helped build this website from the ground 
                up with the goal of bringing good education to all. I have always wanted to lead something important and helpful 
                for the world, and here at LearnX I finally have the chance. I am a programming hobbyist and hope to be one of 
                the leading supports for any teacher who wishes to bring programming to the classroom. I am also a member of the 
                Business Professionals of America, so I understand the importance of working hard and working towards your goals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Honesty: Here at LearnX we hold honesty very closely. As an online school platform, we understand how people can be 
                skeptical of us and how well students may work compared to traditional school settings. But we assure you we will 
                be transparent and help to make sure your child works just as hard on our platform as in a normal school. 
                <br>
                Responsiblity: At LearnX we care a lot about responsibility. The most successful people must be very responsible to 
                get as far as they do, and just as much so to stay there. We make sure any student who uses our platform has the 
                ability to learn how to be responsible and work their way to the top.</p>

                I work at LearnX to revolutionize education for K-12 students, creating an innovative online platform that 
                caters to diverse learning styles. Through research and collaboration with educators, LearnX has created a 
                comprehensive curriculum for core subjects, interactive lessons, and engaging activities to make learning 
                enjoyable. With a commitment to continuous improvement, "LearnX" strives to empower students with the skills 
                and knowledge necessary for success in the ever-changing world.

                <br>
                Courage: The spark that ignites the flame of curiosity in young minds is courage. It serves as the gateway to 
                exploration, empowering children to venture into the realms of knowledge with confidence. By fostering courage,
                we teach resilience, ensuring that every challenge becomes an opportunity for growth and discovery.
                <br>
                Freedom: The key that unlocks the boundless potential of young learners is freedom. It provides children with 
                the liberty to navigate through a diverse array of educational experiences. Through exploration, LearnX inspires 
                a sense of ownership in learning, encouraging children to chart their own course toward a future enriched with 
                knowledge and creativity.
