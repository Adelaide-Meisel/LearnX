                <p>I am the co-founder of LearnX. I helped build this website from the ground up with the goal of 
                bringing good education to all. I have always wanted to lead something important and helpful for the world, 
                and here at LearnX I finally have the chance. I am a programming hobbyist and hope to be one of the leading 
                supports for any teacher who wishes to bring programming to the classroom. By working at LearnX I understand 
                the importance of working hard and working towards your goals as a student.

                Honesty: Here at LearnX we hold honesty very closely. As an online school platform, we understand how people can be 
                skeptical of us and how well students may work compared to traditional school settings. But we assure you we will 
                be transparent and help to make sure your child works just as hard on our platform as in a normal school. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Responsiblity: At LearnX we care a lot about responsibility. The most successful people must be very responsible to 
                get as far as they do, and just as much so to stay there. We make sure any student who uses our platform has the 
                ability to learn how to be responsible and work their way to the top.</p>
