    What is better about LearnX?
    <br>
    <br>
    LearnX is a simple-to-use online website for K-12 to learn and grow. We offer class assignments and 
    tailor to the students so we can best help their learning needs. We make learning fun by using a belt
    system and as students go up grade levels, their belt colors will upgrade.

    How secure will my child's and the school's information be kept?

    What is the belt system?
    <br>
    <br>
    The belt system gives a fun way for K-12 students to learn by color coding each grade. The color will become
    more prominent as they get father into the grade.
